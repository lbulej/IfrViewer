# IfrViewer

**IN DEVELOPMENT - Subject to change!**


Tool that is able to read a binary HPK package and most (hopefully all in future) of its HII and IFR structures.  
> A HPK file (used by [EDKII] (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2)) holds so called HII packages (__Human Interface Infrastructure__).
> The content of such a file follows the kind of file structure definition from [UEFI specification] (http://uefi.org/specifications).
> It consist of many various things but mostly it contains strings for different languages
> and IFR structures (__Internal Forms Representation__) to be able to build the SETUP menu for UEFI capable systems.

## Goals
1. List all IFR related data in order to HPK content in the first place
2. Improve GUI to handle this data more efficient
3. Create HTML pages and use browser to show the skeleton of the HPK's forms
