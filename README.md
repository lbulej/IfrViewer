# IfrViewer

**IN DEVELOPMENT - Subject to change!**


Tool that is able to read a binary HPK package and most (hopefully all in future) of its HII and IFR structures.  
> A HPK file (used by [EDKII](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2)) holds so called HII packages (__Human Interface Infrastructure__).
> The content of such a file follows the kind of file structure definition from [UEFI specification](http://uefi.org/specifications).
> It can consist of many various things but in most cases it consists of strings for different languages
> and IFR structures (__Internal Forms Representation__) to be able to build the SETUP menu for UEFI capable systems.

## Goals
1. List all IFR structures in order to view a HPK's content
2. Improve GUI to handle this data more efficient
3. Create HTML pages which can be viewed by standard web browser showing the skeleton of the HPK's forms
