# IfrViewer

**IN DEVELOPMENT - Subject to change!**


Tool that is able to read a binary HPK package and most (hopefully all in future) of its HII and IFR structures.  
> A HPK is a __Hii package__ (kind of file structure) comming from UEFI specification.
> It consists of verious things but as a core element it contains strings for different languages
> and IFR structures (__Internal Forms Representation__) to be able to build the SETUP menu for UEFI capable systems.

## Goals
1. List all IFR related data in order to HPK content in the first place
2. Improve GUI to handle this data more efficient
3. Create HTML pages and use browser to show the skeleton of the HPK's forms
